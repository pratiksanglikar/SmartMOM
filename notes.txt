CHAIRMAN LEVI: This is a duly noticed meeting
 of the Legal Services Corporation Board, with notice
 having been published in the Federal Register on
 December 23rd. And so I'm calling the meeting to
 order. This is John Levi. I'm Chairman of the Board.
 And I want to wish everybody a happy New Year.
 DEAN MINOW: Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN LEVI: Can we have a motion to
 approve the agenda?
 M O T I O N
 DEAN MINOW: I so move. Martha Minow.
 CHAIRMAN LEVI: Second?
 FATHER PIUS: Second from Father Pius.
 MS. BROWNE: This is Sharon Browne. Second.
 CHAIRMAN LEVI: All in favor?
 (A chorus of ayes.)
 CHAIRMAN LEVI: So the second item on the
 agenda is the report of the Search Committee regarding
 selection of a candidate for the position of LSC
 President. And so in my dual role as chair of the

 Board and chair of the Search Committee, I will give
 the report.
 But what I would like to suggest is that any
 of the search members, when I'm done, if you wish to
 supplement anything I've said or augment it, please do.
 Be cognizant of the fact that we're on an open line as
 it relates to that.
 And let me just first thank the Committee and
 the Advisory Committee. I've run many searches before.
 This was an outstanding search, run with complete
 confidentiality and integrity throughout the process.
 And we had a first-class search run with the Heidrick
 firm and through the hard work of a committee that made
 itself available, weather notwithstanding, on many,
 many occasions.
 And particularly, for those of you who are
 advisory members, we are so grateful to you. This is
 not service that you had to give. You gave it
 willingly and because you wanted to help LSC, and we
 are all very grateful to you and to the Search
 Committee for working so well together. I want to
 congratulate you and thank you for doing just that.
